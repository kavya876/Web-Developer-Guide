    MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It supports dynamic schemas, making it ideal for applications with changing data structures. MongoDB is widely used in real-time apps, big data, and cloud-native development. It offers high scalability, indexing, aggregation, and geospatial queries. Its seamless integration with JavaScript and Node.js makes it popular in full-stack development.
