    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links that make up a webpage. HTML provides the foundation upon which CSS and JavaScript add design and interactivity. It is constantly evolving, with HTML5 introducing multimedia capabilities and semantic elements that improve accessibility and search engine optimization.
