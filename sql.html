    SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows you to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data using queries. SQL works with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. It supports complex operations like joins, indexing, and transactions. SQL ensures data consistency and integrity, making it essential for web apps, analytics, and enterprise systems.
