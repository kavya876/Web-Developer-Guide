    Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to be platform-independent through its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. It is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile apps (especially Android), and web-based tools. Java is known for its stability, performance, and robust ecosystem including frameworks like Spring and tools like Maven and Eclipse.
