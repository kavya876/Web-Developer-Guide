    Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites. It includes ready-made HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components for creating user interfaces quickly and consistently. Bootstrap simplifies web design with its grid system, prebuilt components like buttons and modals, and built-in support for responsive design. It is widely used by developers to speed up development and ensure cross-browser compatibility.
