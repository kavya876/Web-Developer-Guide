    Node.js is a runtime environment that lets developers run JavaScript on the server side. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model for handling multiple connections efficiently. Node.js is commonly used to build fast, scalable network applications and APIs. Itâ€™s ideal for real-time apps like chat and streaming services. With npm, it offers access to thousands of open-source packages. Node.js is widely used in full-stack development.
